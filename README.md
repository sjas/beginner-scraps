Scraps of code for the GitHub / Python beginner that I am :-) 

-2016-09-15: Created my first script used on a production network, cmdinput1.py. Very simple, asks for input command, runs command against list of Cisco IOS routers listed in file "input.txt", saves the results of the command to "output.txt". I first used it to run a "show cdp n | inc SEP" across all our routers to see which locations do not have a Cisco switch, but have more than a certain number of phones connected. If you look at the code, I am sure you will see all sorts of indications that I am an absolute beginner with this stuff.
